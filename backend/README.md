# backend

FastAPI (Python) backend. It decides what data may be accessed, what is sent to CREAO and what shared findings each researcher may see. CREAO supplies reasoning, not authorization.

| Folder / file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `api/` | FastAPI routes |
| `auth/` | Identity and project permission checks |
| `workspaces/` | Workspace and project management |
| `creao/` | CREAO API adapter |
| `orchestration/` | Agent workflows and evidence assembly |
| `memory/` | Hierarchical, episodic and linked-finding memory |
| `monitoring/` | Alerts and diagnoses |
| `knowledge_sharing/` | Approval and publishing of findings |
| `db/` | SQLite persistence |
| `testcreo.py` | Working CREAO test: starts a hub agent run and polls until it finishes. Uses credits |
| `.env.example` | Every environment variable name with no values. Copy it to `.env` and fill it in |

## CREAO API: verified so far

Base URL `https://agent.creao.ai/api/v1`, header `Authorization: Bearer <capi_ key>`.

| Request | Verified by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /runs` with `{"appId": ..., "inputs": {...}}` | `testcreo.py` | Starts a run and returns `id` |
| `GET /runs/{id}` | `testcreo.py` | Poll until `status` is `completed`, `failed` or `cancelled` |
| `GET /apps/{appId}/runs` | Manual check, 2026-10-23 | Lists past runs. Uses no credits |

- **Hub agent inputs:** `project_path`, `observed_symptom` and `focus_areas` are required. `analysis_depth` is optional and defaults to `standard`. A run without the required inputs completes but only reports what's missing.
- **Hub agent output:** `result.chatText` is the prose reply. `result.text` is a JSON string whose shape depends on the outcome: `{"response": ...}` when inputs were missing, or the inputs echoed back plus summary counts (`issues_confirmed`, `issues_suspected`, `blocking_count`, `reproducibility_score`, `experiments_proposed`) when the analysis ran. The itemized issues are only in the prose.
- A full diagnosis took about 60 seconds. The response includes no credit usage and no artifacts.
- Known-good example run: `tests/fixtures/creao_hub_run_completed.json` (app ID redacted).
- CREAO runs in the cloud and cannot read local folders. Send evidence text, not a local path.
- Replies can contain symbols like `α`, which crash `print()` in a Windows terminal. Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` before running scripts that print replies.
