## 2026-10-23 · `pending` · Add CREAO adapter with issue list, tests and changelog

**Why:** Build plan step 1: one tested module for every CREAO call, and a way for the dashboard to get a list of issues instead of only prose.

**Changed**
- Added `backend/creao/` (`client.py`, `__init__.py`): the CREAO adapter. It checks required inputs before sending, starts runs (never retried, since each start costs credits), polls until done, keeps waiting through rate limits, gives clear errors (`CreaoInputError`, `CreaoRequestError`, `CreaoRunFailed`, `CreaoTimeout`) and never exposes the key.
- Hub runs now send an extra `output_format` input asking the agent to end its reply with a JSON issue list. The adapter moves it into `result.issues` and treats anything not labelled exactly `confirmed` as `suspected`.
- Added `tests/test_creao_client.py` (24 tests against a fake CREAO) and `pytest.ini`.
- Added fixtures `creao_hub_run_missing_inputs.json` (from run history, no credits) and `creao_hub_run_with_issue_list.json`.
- Added `backend/requirements.txt` (requests, python-dotenv, pytest).
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`, updated with every commit.
- Updated `README.md`, `backend/README.md`, `Documents/build-plan.md` and `Documents/dashboard-design.md`.

**Checks**
- `python -m pytest`: 24 passed, no network or credits.
- Real run `790fe5fd` through the adapter: completed, 6 issues returned (2 confirmed, 4 suspected), matching the agent's summary counts.
- Adapter read back both earlier real runs correctly (status checks, no credits).
- Secret scan: no API key or app ID in the commit; `backend/.env` not included.
- Not done: credits per run still need to be read in the CREAO app.

## 2026-10-23 · `c27bea3` · Adopt SimGuard product decisions and verify CREAO hub agent

**Why:** The SimGuard product decisions were settled, so the repo and docs were brought in line with them, and step 1 of the build plan (verify CREAO) was started.

**Changed**
- Restructured folders to the SimGuard layout: `backend/` (`api`, `auth`, `workspaces`, `creao`, `orchestration`, `memory`, `monitoring`, `knowledge_sharing`, `db`), `local_connector/` (`file_access`, `evidence`, `simulation_monitor`) and `tests/`. Removed `agents/`, `shared/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`, `sample-data/` and the empty frontend page folders.
- Rewrote `Documents/build-plan.md` around the 7 steps of the first milestone, each with a checkpoint.
- Renamed `Documents/website-architecture.md` to `Documents/dashboard-design.md` and narrowed it to the dashboard UI.
- Added `backend/testcreo.py` (working CREAO smoke test) and `backend/.env.example`.
- Added `tests/fixtures/creao_hub_run_completed.json`: a real known-good hub agent run (app ID redacted), for use as the mock CREAO.
- `.gitignore`: now ignores SQLite databases and `.pytest_cache/`, and keeps `.env.example` tracked.
- Rewrote `README.md` and `backend/README.md` (adds the verified CREAO API contract).

**Checks**
- Hub agent run with all three inputs completed in about 60 s and correctly identified the time-step stability violation.
- Secret scan of the commit: no API key or app ID; `backend/.env` not included.

## 2026-10-23 · `986e2c3` · Set up project structure and website architecture skeleton

**Why:** First commit: an organized starting structure before any code.

**Changed**
- Added the initial folder layout (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `agents/`, `shared/`, `infra/`, `scripts/`, `sample-data/`), each with a README. Replaced in `c27bea3`.
- Added `Documents/website-architecture.md`: a desktop-first website architecture skeleton.
- Added `README.md` and a `.gitignore` for secrets and build output.

**Checks**
- None (documentation and empty folders only).
